      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        As a Front End Developer with a background in art I face challenges with
        creativity and empathy. From working as a product specialist at a
        medical dispensary to becoming a coffee master at Starbucks, to
        interning at a Stop Motion Studio, and now as a Software Engineer I
        pride myself in becoming an expert in my field and constantly learning
        to evolve with the industry while bringing unique artistic solutions to
        new problems. I lead with empathy in everything I create holding in my
        mind the person or persons I am building it for. This care I bring to my
        clients has made me successful throughout my experience in customer
        service and it makes me an even stronger developer because I am able to
        anticipate the needs of the team members interacting with my code as
        well as the end users engaging with my websites and applications. I look
        at building code as creating a piece of artwork to give the user an
        accessible and pleasurable experience.
