      As a Front End Developer with a background in art I face challenges with
      creativity and empathy. From working as a product specialist at a medical
      dispensary to becoming a coffee master at Starbucks, to interning at a
      motion capture studio, and now as a Software Engineer I pride myself in
      becoming an expert in my field and constantly learning to evolve with the
      industry while bringing unique artistic solutions to new problems. I lead
      with empathy in everything I create holding in my mind the person or
      persons I am building it for. This care I bring to my clients has made me
      successful throughout my experience in customer service and it makes me an
      even stronger developer because I am able to anticipate the needs of the
      team members interacting with my code as well as the end users engaging
      with my websites and applications. I look at building code as creating a
      piece of artwork to give the user an accessible and pleasurable
      experience.
