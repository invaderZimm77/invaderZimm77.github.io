      As a developer, I am committed to the pursuit of knowledge and to
      continuing to hone my skills to improve user experiences. I take a
      creative approach to learning and value authentic interactions. As a
      career changer, I bring a lot of experience from many walks of life I've
      lived, from being a knowledge leader as a coffee master to working on a
      team developing bleeding edge motion capture technology. In my next step I
      look forward to seeing where coding takes me; working with great people
      making a contribution to a team and hopefully the world.
