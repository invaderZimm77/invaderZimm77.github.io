          Sunshine Smoothies is an e-commerce application that lets users shop
          for smoothies, create their own smoothie, and edit smoothies.
          Smoothies are stored in a database. Users can see the smoothies they
          create as well as the smoothies created by others. The store also has
          a default selection of smoothies. If a user is signed in theyâ€™ll have
          the ability to create or edit smoothies.
