        Sunshine Smoothies is an e-commerce application that lets users shop for
        smoothies, create their own smoothie, and edit smoothies. Smoothies are
        stored in a database. Users can see the smoothies they create as well as
        the smoothies created by others. The store also has a default selection
        of smoothies. If a user is signed in theyâ€™ll have the ability to create
        or edit smoothies. This project was developed as group collaboration.{" "}
